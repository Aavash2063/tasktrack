# Checkpoint 1 Reflection

## What I Implemented
For this checkpoint, I implemented the ability to create a task and display all tasks using the Task and TaskList classes.

## Challenges I Faced
Setting up the build system and required tools took time, especially configuring CMake correctly, but once it was set up, the project built and ran smoothly.

## What I Learned
I learned how header files connect to implementation files and how CMake manages the build process for a C++ project.

## Testing Results
All manual test cases passed, and the program behaved as expected in normal and edge-case scenarios.

## Questions for Next Checkpoint
Should input validation be handled mainly in main.cpp or inside the class methods?

## Time Spent
Approximately 4 hours
