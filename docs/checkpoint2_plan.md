# Checkpoint 2: Second Feature Plan

## Feature Name
Mark Task as Completed

## Description
This feature allows the user to mark an existing task as completed. Completed tasks are visually distinguished when displayed.

## Why This Feature?
I chose this feature because it builds directly on the task creation feature and adds real usefulness. It extends existing classes without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Classes Involved
- Task
- TaskList
- TaskManager
- main.cpp

## Expected User Workflow
1. User views all tasks
2. User selects a task number
3. User chooses to mark it as completed
4. Task status updates and is displayed

## Estimated Time
Approximately 2–3 hours
