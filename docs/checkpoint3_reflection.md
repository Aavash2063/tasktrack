# Checkpoint 3 – Reflection

## What I Implemented
For this checkpoint, I implemented file saving and loading for tasks.
Tasks can now be written to a file and restored when the program runs again.

## Integration With Previous Features
This feature builds directly on adding tasks and marking them as completed.
Saved tasks preserve their completion status and categories when loaded.

## Challenges Faced
The main challenge was keeping the file format simple and consistent.
Debugging test failures helped me better understand how my classes interact.

## What I Learned
I learned how to use file streams in C++ and how to serialize and deserialize objects.
I also gained more experience writing automated tests with CTest.

## Testing Results
All three automated tests passed.
Tests covered saving and loading, completion persistence, and error handling.

## Overall Project Completion Progress
About 80% of my planned features are now complete.
The main remaining feature is editing existing tasks.
I feel on track to complete the project before the final deadline.

## Time Spent
Approximately 3 to 4 hours.
