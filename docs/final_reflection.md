# Final Project Reflection – TaskTrack

## Section 1: Project Summary
TaskTrack is a command-line task management application written in C++. It allows users to add tasks, display them, mark them as completed, and save/load tasks from a file.

Implemented features:
- Add tasks
- Display tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Save tasks to file
- Load tasks from file

The project does a good job of organizing data using classes and vectors, and it runs reliably without crashes.

## Section 2: Additional Work (Option B: Polish and Complete)
Instead of adding a fourth feature, I focused on polishing and completing my existing features. I finalized file save/load functionality, ensured all features integrate correctly, fixed bugs found during testing, and added automated test coverage using CTest. This improved program reliability, code organization, and overall project completeness.

## Section 3: What Remains
The main remaining feature from my original plan is editing existing tasks. Input validation could also be improved further.

To consider the project fully complete, I would add task editing and improve user input handling.

## Section 4: Time Estimates for Remaining Work

| Remaining Item | Time Estimate | Priority |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Edit tasks | 1–2 hours | Must-have |
| Input validation improvements | 1 hour | Nice-to-have |

## Section 5: What I Learned
I improved my understanding of C++ classes, header/source file separation, vectors, and file I/O. The hardest part was debugging build and test errors. If starting over, I would design tests earlier. I am most proud of getting file save/load working and passing all CTest cases.

This project helped me better understand how data structures are used in real applications.

## Section 6: Time Log
- Planning and design: 4 hours  
- Implementation: 10 hours  
- Testing and debugging: 6 hours  
- Documentation: 3 hours  
- Total: ~23 hours
