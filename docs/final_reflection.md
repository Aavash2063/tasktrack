# Final Project Reflection – TaskTrack

## Section 1: Project Summary
TaskTrack is a command-line task management application written in C++. It allows users to create tasks, view them, mark them as completed, and save/load tasks from a file.

Implemented features include adding tasks, displaying tasks, marking tasks as completed, and file save/load functionality. The project works well as a simple and reliable task tracker with persistent storage.

## Section 2: What Remains
Some features from the original plan are not yet implemented:
- Editing existing tasks
- More advanced input validation
- Deleting tasks

There are no major bugs, but the user interface could be improved with clearer prompts and additional options.

To consider the project fully complete, I would need to implement task editing and improve error handling.

## Section 3: Time Estimate for Remaining Work

| Remaining Item | Time Estimate | Priority |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Edit tasks | 1–2 hours | Must-have |
| Input validation | 1 hour | Nice-to-have |
| UI improvements | 1 hour | Nice-to-have |

## Section 4: What I Learned
This project helped me better understand C++ class design, object interaction, and separating code into header and implementation files. The hardest part was integrating file I/O with existing logic and debugging test failures.

If I started over, I would design the class interfaces more carefully at the beginning. I am most proud of getting save/load functionality working and passing automated tests.

My understanding of data structures improved, especially working with vectors and managing object state.

## Section 5: Time Log
- Planning and design: 4 hours  
- Implementation: 8 hours  
- Testing and debugging: 5 hours  
- Documentation: 3 hours  

**Total: ~20 hours**
