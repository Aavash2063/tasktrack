# Checkpoint 3: Third Feature Plan

Task Completion via Menu Selection

## Description

## Why This Feature?
After adding and displaying tasks, the next logical step is allowing users to update task status. This makes the application more practical and closer to a real-world task manager.

## Classes Involved
- Task

## Expected User Workflow
The user selects the "Mark task as completed" option from the menu, enters a task number, and the selected task is marked as completed.
